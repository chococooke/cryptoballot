## Features

- Create and manage voting events.
- Register as a candidate for an election.
- Cast votes securely and transparently.
- View election results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM/Yarn
- Ethereum Wallet or MetaMask

### Installation

1. Follow the commands below ðŸ˜ƒ

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/cryptoballot.git

cd cryptoballot/frontend
```
2. Make changes in .env

- => open the folder in your favorite code editor 
- => Replace the `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` by your deployed contract's `address`.

3. Start the App.

```bash
npm install

npm start
```


## Architecture

CryptoBallot is built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts for the backend logic. The frontend is developed using React.js, which interacts with the Ethereum blockchain through Ethers.js to access the smart contracts and display the voting interface to users.

The application follows a decentralized architecture, where the smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum network, ensuring transparency and immutability of the voting process. Users interact with the application through their MetaMask wallets, which enables them to participate in voting events and cast their votes securely.

## Technologies Used
- Ethereum blockchain
- Solidity for writing smart contracts
- React.js frontend
- Ethers.js for Ethereum interactions
- Sass for styling
